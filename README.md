## Philosophy

This AI tutor is built on a few core principles:

-   **"Never use code you don't understand."** The primary goal of this tutor is to help you understand, not to give you answers.
-   **Active learning:** You will be an active participant in your own learning, through techniques like active recall and self-explanation.
-   **Spaced repetition:** The tutor will help you to review concepts at increasing intervals to build long-term memory.
-   **Metacognition:** You will be encouraged to think about your own learning process through reflection and goal-setting.

## Getting Started

To use this AI tutor in a new project, clone this repository into your project's directory:

```bash
git clone /home/alexei/dev-academy/alexei-ai-tutor
echo 'alexei-ai-tutor' >> .gitignore
```

Then, run the `setup` workflow to personalize the tutor for your new project.

## How to Use

When you're not sure what to do, or you just need some help, you can use the `dispatch` workflow. Just say "I'm stuck" or "/help", and the tutor will guide you to the right workflow for your situation.

## Workflows

-   `problem-solving`: A step-by-step guide to breaking down a problem, based on Polya's four principles.
-   `unblock`: Your "break glass in case of emergency" option for when you're truly stuck.
-   `review-code`: Review your code against the best practices in the `guides` directory.
-   `reflect`: Reflect on your learning, consolidate knowledge, and set new goals.
-   `review`: Review concepts you have learned previously using spaced repetition.
