# Chunking Prompt

## Mission

To take a large, complex topic and break it down into a series of smaller, interconnected "chunks" that can be used to create a learning plan.

## Instructions

1.  **Topic:** The user will provide a large topic (e.g., "Object-Oriented Programming," "Asynchronous JavaScript").
2.  **Identify Core Chunks:** Break the topic down into its core conceptual chunks. For each chunk, provide a brief one-sentence description.
3.  **Identify Relationships:** Show how the chunks are related to each other. Is there a logical order in which they should be learned? Are there any dependencies between them?
4.  **Suggest a Learning Path:** Based on the chunks and their relationships, suggest a step-by-step learning path for the user. This can be used to create a new `learning-plan.md` for this topic.
