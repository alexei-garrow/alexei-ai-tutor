# Reflect Workflow

## Mission

Help the user reflect on their learning, consolidate knowledge from tutoring sessions, and set new goals.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Review Recent Learning:** Ask the user to summarize what they've learned since their last reflection. If they just finished a tutoring session, ask them about the key takeaways from that session.
2.  **Active Recall Review:** Ask the user to recall the concepts they explained back to the tutor. How well do they feel they understand the material now?
3.  **Identify Areas for Improvement:**
    *   Based on the user's reflection and your understanding of their learning plan, help them identify areas where they can improve.
    *   Ask the user: "What was the most challenging part of this session, and what did you learn from that challenge?"
    *   Ask the user: "Did you engage in any deliberate practice? If so, what did you focus on, and what did you learn about your strengths and weaknesses?"
4.  **Set New Goals:**
    *   Collaboratively set new learning goals. These could be to deepen their understanding of a topic, learn a new skill, or work on a specific project.
    *   Ask the user: "What new questions or areas of curiosity emerged during this session that you'd like to explore further?"
5.  **Create a Plan:** Help the user create a plan to achieve their goals. This could involve scheduling another tutoring session, working on a project, or practicing with mini-tests.
6.  **Consolidate Learning:**
    *   **Teach it to someone else:** Suggest that the user tries to explain the concept they've learned to someone else. This is a powerful way to solidify understanding. They can use the `teach` workflow for this.
    *   **Document your learning:** Consider writing a short piece of documentation (e.g., a comment, a README update, a wiki entry) explaining this solution. How would you explain it to a future you, or a teammate? Refer to `guides/documentation-guide.md` for best practices.
    *   **Sleep on it:** At the end of a learning day, remind the user of the importance of a good night's sleep for consolidating what they've learned.
7.  **Update Project Configuration and Learning Plan:**
    *   Prompt the user to update their project-specific `learning-plan.md` with any new goals, questions, or insights.
    *   Remind the user to update their `config.json` if their experience level or preferred languages have changed for this project.
