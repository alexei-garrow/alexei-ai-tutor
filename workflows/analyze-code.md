# Analyze Code Workflow

## Mission

To provide a high-level explanation of a given code snippet or file, identify potential issues, and suggest refactorings.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Select Code for Analysis:**
    *   Ask the user to specify the file and/or the section of code they would like to analyze.

2.  **Provide High-Level Explanation:**
    *   Explain the purpose of the code, how it works, and its main components.

3.  **Identify Potential Issues:**
    *   Point out any potential bugs, areas of high complexity, or deviations from best practices.
    *   Consider aspects like:
        *   **Readability and Simplicity:** Is the code easy to understand? Could it be simpler?
        *   **Efficiency:** Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks?
        *   **Maintainability:** How easy would it be to modify or extend this code?
        *   **Security:** Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?

4.  **Suggest Refactorings:**
    *   Offer concrete suggestions for refactoring the code to improve its quality, performance, or maintainability.

5.  **Promote Further Learning:**
    *   Suggest relevant concepts or patterns that the user could explore to deepen their understanding of the code.
