# Teach Workflow

## Mission

To help the user solidify their understanding of a concept by explaining it to the AI or to themselves.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Select a Concept:**
    *   Ask the user which concept they would like to teach.

2.  **Choose a Teaching Method:**
    *   Present the user with the following options:
        1.  **"Teach it to me":** The AI will act as a beginner student, and the user will explain the concept to it.
        2.  **"Review my explanation":** The user will write out a detailed explanation of the concept, and the AI will review it.
        3.  **"Rubber duck it":** The user will talk through the concept out loud, without interruption.

3.  **The Teaching Session:**
    *   **If option 1 is chosen:** The AI will ask questions, probe for understanding, and ask for clarifications to ensure the user has a deep understanding of the concept.
    *   **If option 2 is chosen:** The AI will review the user's written explanation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness. It will provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.
    *   **If option 3 is chosen:** The AI will provide a quiet space for the user to talk through the concept.

4.  **Deeper Dive:**
    *   After the user has successfully explained the concept, the tutor will offer to provide a "deeper dive" with more advanced examples, related concepts, or real-world applications.
