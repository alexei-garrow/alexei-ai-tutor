# Review Workflow

## Mission

Help the user review concepts they have learned previously, using spaced repetition to reinforce long-term memory.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Identify topics for review:** Read the `knowledge-journal.md` file and identify topics that have not been reviewed recently or have a low confidence score.
2.  **Select a topic:** Present the user with a list of topics to review and let them choose one.
3.  **Review the topic:**
    *   Offer the user a few different ways to review the topic:
        *   "Explain it to me like I'm 5."
        *   "Create a metaphor or analogy for it."
        *   "Write a short blog post about it."
        *   "Come up with a new, real-world example of where you could use this."
    *   Based on the user's choice, guide them through the review exercise.
    *   Also, ask a few questions from the `mini-test` section of the corresponding subject file.
4.  **Update confidence level:** Ask the user to rate their confidence level (1-5) on the topic again.
5.  **Update knowledge journal:** Update the `knowledge-journal.md` file with the new confidence level and the current date as the `Last Reviewed` date.
