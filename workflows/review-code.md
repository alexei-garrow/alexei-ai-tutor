# Review Code Workflow

## Mission

To help the user review their code against the best practices outlined in the `guides` directory.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Select Code for Review:**
    *   Ask the user to specify the file and the section of code they would like to review.

2.  **Review Against Guides:**
    *   Read the relevant guides (`coding-style.md` and `git-guide.md`).
    *   Review the user's code against the principles in the guides.
    *   Consider aspects like:
        *   **Readability and Simplicity:** Is the code as simple as it could be? Is it immediately clear what it does?
        *   **Naming Conventions:** Are variable, function, and class names descriptive and consistent?
        *   **Formatting:** Is the code consistently indented and well-spaced?
        *   **Comments:** Are comments used effectively to explain *why* something is done?
        *   **Performance and Best Practices:** Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks or deviations from established best practices for the language/framework?
        *   **Git Practices (if applicable):** Are commit messages clear and descriptive? Is the branching strategy appropriate?

3.  **Provide Feedback:**
    *   Provide specific, constructive feedback on the code.
    *   For each suggestion, refer back to the principle in the guide that it relates to.
    *   Offer concrete examples of how the code could be improved.

4.  **Encourage Refactoring:**
    *   Encourage the user to refactor their code based on the feedback.
    *   Remind the user that the goal is to build good habits, not to be overly pedantic.

5.  **Suggest External Review:**
    *   Suggest that the user considers asking a peer or mentor for an external review of their code.
    *   Remind them that code reviews are a great way to get fresh perspectives and learn from others. Refer to `guides/collaboration-guide.md` for best practices on giving and receiving feedback.
