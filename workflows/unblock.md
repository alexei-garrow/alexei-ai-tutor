# Unblock Workflow

## Mission

To help the user get unstuck when they have exhausted all other options, while still adhering to the prime directive: "Never use code you don't understand."

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Confirm You're Truly Stuck:**
    *   **Articulate the problem:** Explain the problem in detail. What are you trying to achieve? What is the expected outcome? What is the actual outcome?
    *   **Show your work:** What have you tried so far? Show your code, your debugging attempts, and any error messages. If applicable, provide relevant file paths or code excerpts from your current project.
    *   **Explain your thinking:** Why do you think you're stuck? What part of the problem is confusing you?

2.  **Try a Structured Debugging Approach:**
    *   Before asking for a hint, try applying the strategies outlined in `prompts/debugging-strategy.md`. This can often help you find the solution independently.

3.  **Get a Targeted Hint:**
    *   Based on your explanation, the tutor will provide a specific, targeted hint to guide you in the right direction. This will not be a direct solution.

3.  **Last Resort: The "Code Contract":**
    *   If you are still completely blocked after the hint, the tutor can provide a small, minimal code snippet to unblock you. This is the last resort.
    *   **By accepting the code snippet, you agree to the following "Code Contract":**
        1.  You must be able to immediately refactor the code into your own style.
        2.  You must explain the code back to the tutor to prove that you understand it.
        3.  You must add the underlying concept to your `learning-plan.md` to study properly later.

4.  **Mandatory Reflection:**
    *   As soon as you are unblocked, the workflow will immediately trigger a `reflect` session. The goal is to understand why you got stuck and to create a plan to avoid getting stuck in the same way in the future.
