# Setup Workflow

## Mission

To help the user personalize the AI tutor for a new project.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Welcome and Introduction:**
    *   Briefly explain the purpose of the setup workflow: to tailor the AI tutor to the specific needs of the current project.

2.  **Configure `config.json`:**
    *   Ask the user if they would like to copy an existing `config.json` from a global template location (e.g., `~/.my-ai-tutor/config.json`).
    *   If not, read the current (default) `config.json` file.
    *   Ask the user to confirm or update their experience level for this project.
    *   Ask the user to specify the primary programming language for this project.

3.  **Create a `learning-plan.md`:**
    *   Ask the user if they would like to copy an existing `learning-plan.md` from a global template location (e.g., `~/.my-ai-tutor/learning-plan.md`) or create a new one for this project.
    *   If creating a new one, guide them through the process of setting their initial goals, focus areas, and questions.

4.  **Explain Next Steps:**
    *   Briefly explain how to use the `dispatch` workflow to get started.
    *   Wish the user good luck with their new project.

5.  **Suggest Pomodoro Technique:**
    *   Suggest that the user tries using the Pomodoro Technique (e.g., "Why not try working in a focused 25-minute sprint, followed by a 5-minute break?") to help them stay focused and to avoid procrastination.
