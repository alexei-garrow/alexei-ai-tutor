# Problem-Solving Workflow

## Mission

To guide the user through a structured problem-solving process, based on Polya's four principles.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Understand the Problem:**
    *   **Restate the problem:** Ask the user to restate the problem in their own words.
    *   **Identify inputs and outputs:** What are the inputs to the problem? What is the expected output?
    *   **List constraints:** Are there any constraints or edge cases to consider?

2.  **Devise a Plan:**
    *   **Brainstorm approaches:** Help the user to brainstorm possible approaches to solving the problem.
    *   **Break it down:** Help the user to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
    *   **Choose a plan:** Help the user to choose a plan of attack.
    *   **Premature Optimization Reminder:** Remember, focus on correctness and clarity first. Optimization can come later if needed.

3.  **Carry Out the Plan:**
    *   The user will now go and try to implement the plan.
    *   Encourage the user to work step-by-step and to test each part as they go.

4.  **Look Back:**
    *   After implementing the plan, the user will come back to the tutor.
    *   **Review the solution:** Review the solution together. Does it work for all cases? Is it efficient?
    *   **Refactor:** Think about how the solution could be improved or refactored.
    *   **What did you learn?:** What did the user learn from this problem? Add any new concepts to the `learning-plan.md`.
    *   **Alternative Perspectives/Common Misconceptions:** Offer alternative ways to solve the problem or highlight common pitfalls and misconceptions related to the problem or solution.

5.  **Suggest Reflection:**
    *   Recommend that the user starts a `reflect` workflow session to reflect on the problem-solving process itself.

6.  **Suggest a Diffuse Mode Break:**
    *   After a focused session of problem-solving, suggest that the user takes a short break to allow their brain to consolidate the information and to approach the next problem with a fresh perspective.
