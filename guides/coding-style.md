# Coding Style Guide

This guide provides general guidelines for writing clean, readable code. Remember that these are principles, not rigid rules. The most important thing is to be consistent within a project.

## Naming Conventions

- **Variables:** Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the variable. For example, `user_name` is better than `un`.
- **Functions:** Use verbs in your function names to indicate what they do. For example, `calculate_total_price` is better than `price_calculator`.
- **Classes:** Use PascalCase for class names. For example, `class UserProfile`.
- **Constants:** Use all caps with underscores to separate words for constants. For example, `MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100`.

## Formatting

- **Indentation:** Use consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces) to indicate code blocks.
- **Line length:** Keep lines of code to a reasonable length (e.g., 80-120 characters) to improve readability.
- **Whitespace:** Use whitespace to separate logical blocks of code and to improve readability.

## Comments

- Write comments to explain *why* you are doing something, not *what* you are doing. The code should explain what it is doing.
- Keep comments concise and up-to-date.

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### Python

- Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.
- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions.

### JavaScript

- Follow a popular style guide like [Airbnb's](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) or [Google's](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions.
