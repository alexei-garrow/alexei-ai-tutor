2. Immediately create a new branch (e.g., my-new-project-custom) within that cloned tutor repository.
3. Make all your project-specific customizations on that new branch.
4. Regularly push that custom branch to your remote for backup.
5. Periodically merge updates from the main branch (which tracks your template) into your custom branch.
