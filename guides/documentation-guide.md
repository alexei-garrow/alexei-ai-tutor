# Documentation Guide

This guide outlines best practices for creating clear, concise, and effective documentation. Good documentation is crucial for collaboration, maintainability, and solidifying your own understanding.

## Why Document?

-   **For yourself:** Explaining a concept clearly helps you understand it better.
-   **For others:** Makes your code easier for teammates to understand and use.
-   **For future you:** You'll thank yourself later when you revisit old code.

## Types of Documentation

1.  **Inline Comments:**
    *   Explain *why* a piece of code exists or *why* a particular decision was made, not *what* the code does (the code should be self-explanatory).
    *   Clarify complex algorithms or tricky logic.

2.  **Function/Method Docstrings (or similar):**
    *   Describe the purpose of the function.
    *   Explain its parameters, what they represent, and their types.
    *   Describe what the function returns.
    *   Mention any exceptions it might raise.
    *   Provide simple examples of how to use it.

3.  **Module/File-Level Documentation:**
    *   Provide an overview of the module's purpose and its main components.
    *   Explain how different parts interact.

4.  **Project READMEs:**
    *   A high-level overview of the project.
    *   Instructions for setup, installation, and running tests.
    *   Examples of usage.
    *   Contribution guidelines.

## Best Practices

-   **Be Concise:** Get straight to the point. Avoid unnecessary jargon.
-   **Be Clear:** Use simple, unambiguous language.
-   **Be Accurate:** Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation.
-   **Be Consistent:** Use a consistent style and format throughout your documentation.
-   **Audience:** Write for your intended audience (e.g., a new developer, a user, a future you).
-   **Examples:** Always include code examples where appropriate.
